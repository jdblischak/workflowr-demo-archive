Generate some values from a normal distribution.

```{r create}
mean_value <- sample(1:10, size = 1)
normal_dist <- rnorm(5, mean = mean_value)
```

Archive them.

```{r archive}
wflow_archive(mean_value, normal_dist)
```

Restore them.

```{r restore}
restored <- wflow_restore(mean_value, normal_dist)
str(restored)
```

Analyze them.

```{r analysis}
mean_set <- sapply(restored$mean_value, function(x) x)
mean_estimate <- sapply(restored$normal_dist, function(x) mean(x))
error <- abs(mean_set - mean_estimate)
d <- data.frame(mean_set, error, commit = names(error))
ggplot(d, aes(x = mean_set, y = error, label = commit)) +
  geom_text() +
  labs(x = "Actual mean",
       y = "Absolute error between actual and estimated mean",
       title = "Relationship between the mean, its estimation error, and commit")
```

## Decisions

The functions `wflow_archive` and `wflow_restore` use the name of the file to
save and load the objects. Thus this only works if the file is knit. Running the
chunks individually (e.g. "Run All" in RStudio) cannot access the name of the
current file. What do we want the behaviour to be?

The function currently use non-standard evaluation tricks so that the objects
can be directly passed (instead of creating a named list). This works great
unless they are embedded inside of another function. Do we expect it will be
common to embed these functions within other functions? If yes, we need to make
standard evaluation options avaialable as well (e.g. dplyr has the non-standard
evalation function `select` and the corresponding standard evalation `select_`
for use inside functions).

What beyond the sha1? The commit message? The date?

How to commit them? Have `wflow_commit` check the archive directory? This may
need to wait until a configuration file is implemented.

What about the files created while testing? These will have the wrong commit.
